# Predictive scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
- [Predictive scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-predictive-scaling.html)
- In general, if you have regular patterns of traffic increases and applications that take a long time to initialize, you should consider using predictive scaling. Predictive scaling can help you scale faster by launching capacity in advance of forecasted load, compared to using only dynamic scaling, which is reactive in nature. Predictive scaling can also potentially save you money on your EC2 bill by helping you avoid the need to overprovision capacity.
