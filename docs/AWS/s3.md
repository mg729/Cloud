## Bucket_policy
- [Add a bucket policy that makes your bucket content publicly available](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html)
    - After you edit S3 Block Public Access settings, you can add a bucket policy to grant public read access to your bucket. When you grant public read access, anyone on the internet can access your bucket.

## OAI
- Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin access identity (OAI) of that S3 bucket. Restrict Amazon S3 access to the OAI.

## Storage_Class
- Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose
- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)
- Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
- Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering
    - `S3 Intelligent-Tiering` for data with unknown or changing access patterns. It is a new Amazon S3 storage class designed for customers who want to optimize storage costs automatically when data access patterns change, without performance impact or operational overhead.
- Amazon Glacier
    - Data is retained for the longer term (10s of years)
- Amazon Glacier Deep Archive
    - for long term storage â€“ cheaper

cf) Minimal storage duration means the min days post which you are not charged a fee.

If you store in Glacier today where min days is 90, deleting an object tomorrow will mean you will be charged for the full 90 days.
This does not mean you cannot move an object directly into Glacier.

## Performance
- Multi-Part upload
- S3 Transfer Acceleration
