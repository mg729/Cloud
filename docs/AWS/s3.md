## Bucket policy
- [Add a bucket policy that makes your bucket content publicly available](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html)
    - After you edit S3 Block Public Access settings, you can add a bucket policy to grant public read access to your bucket. When you grant public read access, anyone on the internet can access your bucket.

## OAI
- Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin access identity (OAI) of that S3 bucket. Restrict Amazon S3 access to the OAI.

## Storage Class
- Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose
- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)
- Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
- Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering
    - `S3 Intelligent-Tiering` for data with unknown or changing access patterns. It is a new Amazon S3 storage class designed for customers who want to optimize storage costs automatically when data access patterns change, without performance impact or operational overhead.
- Amazon Glacier
    - Data is retained for the longer term (10s of years)
- Amazon Glacier Deep Archive
    - for long term storage – cheaper

>  cf) Minimal storage duration means the min days post which you are not charged a fee.

- If you store in Glacier today where min days is 90, deleting an object tomorrow will mean you will be charged for the full 90 days.
This does not mean you cannot move an object directly into Glacier.

## Performance
- Multi-Part upload
- S3 Transfer Acceleration

## Transition of Storage Class

## Storage Gateway + S3 Glacier
- [AWS Storage Gateway Service Integrates Tape Gateway with Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive Storage Class](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/03/aws-storage-gateway-service-integrates-tape-gateway-with-amazon-s3-glacier-deeparchive-storage-class/?nc1=h_ls)
- The AWS Storage Gateway service now integrates Tape Gateway with Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, allowing you to store virtual tapes in the lowest-cost Amazon S3 storage class, reducing the monthly cost to store your long-term data in the cloud by up to 75%. S3 Glacier Deep Archive is a new S3 storage class that provides secure, durable object storage for long-term data retention and digital preservation.

## VPC endpoints for S3
- [Amazon S3: gateway endpoints and interface endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html)  
    - Gateway Endpoint 
        - Provisions a gateway and must be used as a target in a route table
        - Supports both **S3 and DynamoDB**
        - 게이트웨이 유형 엔드포인트는 S3 및 DynamoDB를 비롯한 AWS 서비스에서만 이용할 수 있습니다. 이러한 엔드포인트는 사용자가 선택한 라우팅 테이블에 항목을 추가하고, 트래픽을 Amazon의 프라이빗 네트워크를 통해 지원되는 서비스로 라우팅합니다.

    - Interface endpoint 
        - Provisions an ENI (private IP address) as an entry point (must attach a Security Group)
        - Supports most AWS services
        - 인터페이스 유형 엔드포인트는 AWS 서비스인 PrivateLink에서 지원하는 서비스, 자체 서비스 또는 SaaS 솔루션에 비공개로 연결할 수 있으며, Direct Connect를 통한 연결을 지원합니다. 

## Snowball Edge
- **Snowball Edge (for data transfers)**
  - Physical data transport solution: move *TBs or PBs of data* in or out of AWS
  - Transfer the on-premises data into multiple Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices. Copy the Snowball Edge data into Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy to transition the data into AWS Glacier
  -  The data stored on the Snowball Edge device can be copied into the S3 bucket and later transitioned into AWS Glacier via a lifecycle policy. **You can't directly copy data from Snowball Edge devices into AWS Glacier.**

## Athena
- Serverless query service to perform analytics against S3 objects

## S3 Data Transfer Pricing
- S3 Transfer Acceleration:
	- Faster transfer times (50 to 500% better)
	- Additional cost on top of Data Transfer
    - Pricing: +$0.04 to $0.08 per GB
- S3 to CloudFront: $0.00 per GB
